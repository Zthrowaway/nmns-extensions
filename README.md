## Want to develop your own source?
Check out the extensions common repo [here](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/extensions-common/wiki/Intro-to-Paperback-Sources), use one of the current implementations in the repo as an example, and/or ask in Paperback's official [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ny83JV3) server
