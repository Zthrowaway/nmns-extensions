## June 24, I have no idea what I'm doing, feel free to message me if you know how to make a paperback extension haha. 



My try at paperback sources, this time with a little more experience

## Want to develop your own source?
You can reverse engineer the extensions common repo, currently [here](https://github.com/topics/paperback-source) on GitHub. 

According to NmN's 0.8 extension and some others, you can check out the extensions common repo [here](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/extensions-common/wiki/Intro-to-Paperback-Sources) ([archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20220407070127/https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/extensions-common/wiki/Intro-to-Paperback-Sources)], use one of the current implementations in the repo as an example, and/or ask in Paperback's official [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ny83JV3) server, but the discord link is expired and the page isn't helpful at all :/
